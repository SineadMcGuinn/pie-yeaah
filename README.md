### Color Scheme

Accessibility is of upmost importance when designing the site.  I used coolors.co, color contrast checker to ensure that the text color and the background color would have a healthy contrast ratio.  I selected #FFFF00 for the logo writing and #284646 for the background of the header and footer.
